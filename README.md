This Project usually developed to overcome the problem of splitting of amount manually.
Splitwise and other apps are there, but still few prefer to write them on notes. 
For Those people, this is helpful.

NOTE: The project can only detect the amount if we wrote "/-" at the end. we used REGEX for this :)

1.Open Terminal of VSCODE
2.Create a virtual environment
